<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p> Adults reach about 48 cm and weight approximately 950 g, so a size comparable to, for example, a crow. <br>
    It is mostly olive-green with a brilliant orange under its wings and has a large, narrow, curved, grey-brown upper
    beak. The span of their wings is over 1 m.</p>

<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>In the wild, they only live in the South Island of New Zealand.<br>
    They live in mountain areas with an altitude of 600 to 2000 m, but they wait out the winter in the forests below the
    mountains, where they can hide from the strong wind.</p>

<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Kea are omnivores with very varied diets. They mostly consume plants supplemented by insects, larvae, and small
    mammals. <br>
    In the spring they mostly eat flowering alpine plants, in the summer they eat berries and tree fruits. In the autumn
    and winter they mainly survive by eating insects.<br>
    They also often pick up garbage near human settlements and eat leftovers from it.</p>
<h3>Threats and Conservation</h3>
<p>They often cause damage to property. This happens especially to sheep farmers, so even though kea are endangered,
    they are illegally hunted by them. <br>
    The Department of Conservation estimates that by 2020 there are about 3-7 thousand kea left in the wild.</p>
<h3>Social interactions and Intelligence</h3>
<p>Like most parrots, kea live in life-long relationships with one partner in a flock. A flock usually consists of about
    5-15 individuals. <br>
    Social interaction is key to their survival. Through observation and cooperation within the flock they learn how to
    recognize danger, <br>
    or teach each other what plants are edible. They even learned how to use tools to set of traps in order to get food
    from them.</p>
